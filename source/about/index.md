I'm CTO at Neurologic, where our focus is applying deep learning into natural language processing for conversational agents and predicting human behaviour.

Actually my research focus is inside temporal networks, in the following fields:
- Few-shot learning
- Recurrent Reinforcement Agents
- Transfer Learning
- Structured Prediction
- Attentive Networks
- DAGs; VAEs; GANs
- Improving Regularization Techniques in NLP for Brazilian Portuguese (denoising)

I was studying general artificial intelligence since my 15 years old, and software development since my 08 years old. After some years trying to work in descriptive logic to solve AI problems, I focused on Machine Learning perspective to solve them.
